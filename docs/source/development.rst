We welcome any contributions for improving or further developing this package.

However, please excuse that we are limited in time for development and support.

Some things to keep in mind when adding code...

========

A few extra libraries are needed for development::

This is enforced through ruff following specifications in pyproject.toml.

A test suite is provided in /src/napari_locan/_tests.

Coverage
===========

For measuring code coverage in testing we use coverage.py_.

.. _coverage.py: https://coverage.readthedocs.io

Configurations are kept in pyproject.toml.

Code checks
============

We use black_ for formating and ruff_ for code linting.

.. _black: https://pypi.org/project/black/
.. _ruff: https://pypi.org/project/ruff

Configurations are kept in pyproject.toml.

To update the documentation from sources delete ``/docs/sources/generated`` and run::

    sphinx-build -b html -E YOUR_PATH\napari-locan\docs YOUR_PATH\napari-locan\docs\_build

Type hints
==============

We try to make use of type checking using mypy_ as much as possible.

.. _mypy: https://pypi.org/project/mypy

Configurations are kept in pyproject.toml.

============

* The plugin is strongly linked to locan_ and its development procedures.
