.. _introduction:

This plugin allows loading, visualizing and analyzing
single-molecule localization (SMLM) data.
napari-locan is well suited for exploratory data analysis.

It implements a subset of methods from [locan], a python-based library with
code for analyzing SMLM data.
Such data is typically generated in fluorescence-based super-resolution microscopy methods.
Single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques rely on finding the position of single-molecule
emitters in time and space and reconstructing a super-resolved image or movie.
The generated localizations are analyzed point-by-point for statistical and structural insight.

Locan provides extended functionality that is better suited for script- or
notebook-based analysis procedures.
